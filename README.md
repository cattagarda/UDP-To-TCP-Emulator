To run the code, compile both UDPtoTCPServer.java and UDPtoTCPClient.java and run on java. You can run the program on Eclipse (recommended)

The packet window size can be edited by changing the value of the variable windowSize on both client and server. Both values should match. 


Packets are dropped 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% and are chosen randomly each runtime.
